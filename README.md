# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset of vehicle prices, build a regression model to predict price based on vehicle features, and present the findings. The process involves in-depth data exploration, feature engineering, training and evaluating multiple models, hyperparameter tuning, error analysis, and model interpretability.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khwaishsaxena/vehicle-price-prediction-dataset/data). The dataset consists of 17 columns and 1002 rows.

Below is the description of each column in the dataset

* name: The full name of the vehicle, including make, model, and trim.
* description: A brief description of the vehicle, often including key features and selling points.
* make: The manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Ford, Toyota, BMW).
* model: The model name of the vehicle.
* year: The year the vehicle was manufactured.

* engine: Details about the engine, including type and specifications.
* cylinders: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.
* fuel: The type of fuel used by the vehicle (e.g., Gasoline, Diesel, Electric).
* mileage: The mileage of the vehicle, typically in miles.
* transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).
* trim: The trim level of the vehicle, indicating different feature sets or packages.
* body: The body style of the vehicle (e.g., SUV, Sedan, Pickup Truck)
* doors: The number of doors on the vehicle.
* exterior_color: The exterior color of the vehicle.
